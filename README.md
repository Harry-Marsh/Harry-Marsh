Hi, I'm Harry Marsh

I'm a mathematics graduate transitioning into backend development. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through code and building functional, well-structured systems.

ðŸ§± I recently built a full CRUD Workout Logger API using Python and Flask â€” a hands-on project that helped me learn RESTful routing, JSON handling, and file-based storage.

ðŸ’¡ My background in mathematics has given me strong skills in logic, algorithms, and pattern recognition â€” which I now apply to backend systems and clean, testable code.

ðŸŽ¯ I'm currently open to backend internships or junior roles where I can continue learning, building, and contributing in a real-world setting.
