## Projects  

### Workout Logger API (Flask, Python)  
- Built a backend API with full CRUD functionality and input validation.  
- Structured and managed datasets, demonstrating backend principles and clean data handling.  

### Monte Carlo Simulation Dissertation (R, Python)  
- Applied Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to financial risk and PDE simulations.  
- Explored random number generation, rejection/importance sampling, and variance reduction.  
- Achieved strong results validating theory against simulations.  

### Logistic Regression for Health Outcomes (Python, statsmodels)  
- Modelled health dataset outcomes using logistic regression.  
- Cleaned and transformed real-world data, interpreting predictors through odds ratios and confidence intervals.  
- Showcased practical statistical modelling for applied decision-making.  

### Statistical Inference (Python, R)  
- Implemented hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and Bayesian updating.  
- Compared Frequentist vs Bayesian methods, coding tests to replicate theoretical results.  
- Applied inference methods to guide data-driven decision-making.
